# dotfiles
Aggregation of all my config files and scripts for my Arch Linux desktop.

A lot of configs/scripts use my local path (e.g. for images), so they might not be fully portable.
The main purpose for this repo is to showcase my workflow and applications I utilize on a daily basis.

If you want to use my scripts, copy the `scripts` folder into your home directory (i.e. `~/scripts`). You could add this directory to your local path, but the scripts I write are mainly incorporated into config files and are not usually run manually.
