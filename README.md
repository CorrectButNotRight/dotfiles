# dotfiles
Aggregation of all my config files and scripts for my Arch Linux desktop.

A lot of configs/scripts use my local path (e.g. for images), so they might not be fully portable.
The main purpose for this repo is to showcase my workflow and applications I utilize on a daily basis.

I'm using a git bare repository, and so all of the directories in here are located in the home directory. 
If the repo is cloned into your home directory, all scripts and configs should run out of the box, with the exception of configurations that depend on computer specific values (e.g. display output identifier)
